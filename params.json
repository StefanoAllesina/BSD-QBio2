  "body": "## Welcome\r\n\r\nThis page contains important information about the [Second BSD-qBio Bootcamp @ MBL](http://bsdgrad.uchicago.edu/page/mbl-quantitative-approaches-bootcamp), which will be held at the [Marine Biological Laboratory](http://www.mbl.edu/) in Woods Hole, MA, on Sept 6-14, 2016.\r\n\r\nMore that 90 incoming graduate students from the different programs in the [Division of Biological Sciences](http://www.bsd.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu) will participate.\r\n\r\nOn this page, you find the instructions on how to **prepare your laptop** so that it's ready for the boot camp.\r\n\r\nYou should also **take a look at the data and the code** we will explore in the workshops and tutorials.\r\n\r\nYou can see the **schedule** of the boot camp, and find the contact information for the directors.\r\n\r\n## Contacts\r\n\r\nFor any issue/question/comment, please contact the course directors:\r\n\r\n- [Stephanie Palmer](mailto:sepalmer@uchicago.edu?Subject=Help%20BSD%20QBio)\r\n([webpage](http://http//palmerlab.uchicago.edu))\r\n- [Stefano Allesina](mailto:sallesina@uchicago.edu?Subject=Help%20BSD%20QBio)\r\n([webpage](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/))\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\n\r\nThe qBio2 boot camp will be, as the name implies, quite intense. We are going to have **Tutorials** (short primers to a certain topic) and **Workshops** (discipline-specific, hands-on activities). We will dedicate Sunday night to **Professional Development**, with armchair discussions on how to get the most out of your graduate school.\r\n\r\nYou will get to know MBL better, with **Talks from MBL researchers**, a tour of the facilities, and even a **trip on the [Gemma](http://www.sciencemetropolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_0782.jpg)**.\r\n\r\nHere's the [general schedule](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/raw/master/schedule/GeneralSchedule.pdf).\r\n\r\nYou can also browse the schedule [by group](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/tree/master/schedule). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Computing tutorials\r\n\r\nTo accommodate the diverse background of our students, we have created two tracks for the computing tutorials. \r\n\r\n- Basic Computing I and II: dedicated to new users who are not familiar with `R` or programming in general. It will guide students step-by-step, introducing the `R` syntax and showing how to write well-organized code for data analysis and scientific research.\r\n- Advanced Computing I and II: dedicated to experienced `R` users, will focus on manipulating large data sets, plotting, the UNIX terminal, and the use of regular expressions. \r\n\r\nTo decide which track you want to choose, please consult the lecture materials, and make sure that the content is at the right level for you:\r\n\r\n- Basic Computing I ([web](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/blob/master/tutorials/basic_computing_1/code/basic_computing_1.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/raw/master/tutorials/basic_computing_1/code/basic_computing_1.pdf))\r\n- Basic Computing II ([web](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/blob/master/tutorials/basic_computing_2/code/basic_computing_2.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/raw/master/tutorials/basic_computing_2/code/basic_computing_2.pdf))\r\n- Advanced Computing I ([web](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/blob/master/tutorials/advanced_computing_1/code/advanced_computing_1.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/raw/master/tutorials/advanced_computing_1/code/advanced_computing_1.pdf))\r\n- Advanced Computing II ([web](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/blob/master/tutorials/advanced_computing_2/code/advanced_computing_2.Rmd), [pdf](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/raw/master/tutorials/advanced_computing_2/code/advanced_computing_2.pdf))\r\n\r\n## Preparing your laptop\r\n\r\nWe are going to start working right away. Therefore, it is very important you **prepare your laptop** for the boot camp before you leave for MBL.\r\n\r\nYou will work on your laptop all day long. **If you don't have a laptop, please contact Stefano or Stephanie immediately**.\r\n\r\n### All platforms\r\n\r\nWe're going to have students using Windows, OSX, and Linux. Whatever your platform, make sure to:\r\n\r\n- **Install R**: go to [this page](https://cran.rstudio.com/), download the file corresponding to your platform, and install it. (Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZbjUEg4a1g) explaining how to install R and RStudio in Windows; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rp9bkc68y0) for Mac OSX)\r\n    \r\n- **Install RStudio**: once installed R, go to [this page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/), download the installer for your operating system (section **Installers for Supported Platforms**), and install the software.\r\n\r\n- Once installed R and RStudio, open RStudio and **install the following packages**:\r\n  - ggplot2\r\n  - dplyr\r\n  - tidyr\r\n  - stringr\r\n  - deSolve\r\n  - lubridate\r\n  - ggthemes\r\n\r\n  You can find instructions on how to install R packages in RStudio [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RWb5U3X-T8).\r\n\r\n- **Install ImageJ**: go to [this page](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/) and follow the instructions for your platform.\r\n\r\n### Windows users\r\n\r\nIf you are using Windows, you need to install a UNIX emulator. We suggest downloading the version control software `Git` (which we are not going to use, but that you might want to master!), because it ships with a small emulator (`Git Bash`). Simply go to [this page](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n## Downloading the data\r\n\r\nThere are two options: \r\n\r\n- If you're familiar with `Git`, clone the repository\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2.git\r\n```\r\n  making sure that the directory is created within your home (Linux: `home/yourname`, Mac OSX:  `Users/yourname`, Windows `Users/yourname`). \r\n\r\n- If you're not familiar with `Git`, download the [zip file](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/BSD-QBio2/archive/master.zip), and extract it to your home directory. Make sure to rename the folder to `BSD-QBio2` (it will be extracted as `BSD-QBio2-master`).\r\n",
