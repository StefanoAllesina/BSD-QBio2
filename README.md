# BSD-QBio2
Second BSD QBio Boot Camp

## Instructions for instructors
- Please upload your files under `tutorials` or `workshops`, as needed
- Ideally, each tutorial/workshop includes the following: `code` (the code for the activity), `data` (the data needed for the activity), `readings` (papers, manuals, other readings), `resources` (cheat-sheets, links to online tutorials)
- The language should be `R`. Refrain from using too many special packages, unless you want to teach how to use them.
- If possible, include the code as an `R-MarkDown` file (`.Rmd`), outputting a `pdf`.

## Structure of the document
If possible, start by stating the **Goal** of the tutorial, the intended **Audience**, and the **Installation** needs. For example:

- **Goal:** learn how to manipulate large data sets by writing efficient, consistent, and compact code. Introduce the use of `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and the "pipeline" operator `%>%`. Produce beautiful graphs and figures for scientific publications using `ggplot2`.

- **Audience:** experienced `R` users, familiar with the data type `data.frame`, loops, functions, and having some notions of data bases.

- **Installation:** the following packages need to be installed: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`, `ggthemes`

If possible, **include a few small exercises to break the flow**. These are useful for people to catch up with the class, and to make sure they understood what they've just heard.

Conclude with a series of **more substantial exercises** that the students will solve in small groups. For the tutorials, I would suggest using at least 45 mins for group exercises.

## Help
If you need any help with wiring the code, feel free to contact me (sallesina@uchicago.edu)

## Uploading
If you're on GitHub, send me your username and I will add you to the repo; otherwise, share the files with me through Dropbox, Google Drive, or email (if small).
