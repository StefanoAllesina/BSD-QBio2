# dirtune is a matrix with 824 rows (trials) and 109 columns (spike times) containing spike time for that trial
# theta is a vector of 824 elements indexing which element of the directions variable is associated with each trial
# Finally, RFMap is a 4-dimensional array

#  To count the number of spikes at each location on the grid, write a for loop that will step though the
#  x and y positions on the grid.  Then at each position find the number of non-zero entries in the array RFmap.

#  The number of x positions in the grid is 15, i.e. dim(numspks)[2] or dim(RFmap)[2]
#  You can certainly just use 10 and 15, but if you were trying to write a script that would give you RFmaps from 
#  differently sized grids, your code wouldn't run!  Sometimes it is helpful to stay general

    # stimulus.  The latency of this neuron is about 50ms, so spike times < 45ms are not a result of the 
    # motion. Create a temporary variable "inds" that stores the (non-zero) spike times > 45ms

# Transposing the matrix will please R
